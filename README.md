# PluginPatterns

This is a quick script for showcasing the pattern that I use for creating plugins in RPGMakerMV.
You can download this plugin, and use it in your game to see that it does work, and gives you a bit of insight
on how plugins work in the editor. You can freely make modifications to this plugin; try out different things, and 
what works, and what doesn't.
